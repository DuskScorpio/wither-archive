Wither Cage/Damager
### Versions
- 1.14+

## Features
- Needs the wither to have a layer of blocks around the wither so that it won't track any entities.
- Technically works in 12-13 as well, but if any entity enters it's tracking range while the damager is running it will blow up the damager and escape so it's not recommended
- Most likely the simplest damager possible (non entity based)

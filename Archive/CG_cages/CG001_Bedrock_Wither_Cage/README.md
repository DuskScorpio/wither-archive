A wither cage with bedrock
### Versions
- 1.4.2+

## Features
- Wither can destroy a 3x4x3 region with the lowest layer centered at its tail.

## Notes
- In versions before 1.8, a block instead of a wall is needed since the wither is taller, and the sideways summoning setup doesn't work.
- In versions 1.14 and below, predamage the wither before starting the clock.
- In versions 1.14~1.16, you can no longer push blocks into the wither's tail unless 0-ticked in place.
- In versions 1.17 and above, blocks can be pushed into the wither's tail if the bedrock is 5x5.
### Build
- There is a 2 blocks gap between the 3x3 bedrock and the wall/fence.
- The obsidian is to block the summon explosion from the wither, it will be destroyed after the wither is summoned.
- Needs a layer of blocks around the wither's head to prevent wither targeting nearby mobs.

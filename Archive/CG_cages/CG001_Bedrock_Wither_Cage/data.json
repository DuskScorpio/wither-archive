  "notes": "- In versions before 1.8, a block instead of a wall is needed since the wither is taller, and the sideways summoning setup doesn't work.\n- In versions 1.14 and below, predamage the wither before starting the clock.\n- In versions 1.14~1.16, you can no longer push blocks into the wither's tail unless 0-ticked in place.\n- In versions 1.17 and above, blocks can be pushed into the wither's tail if the bedrock is 5x5.\n### Build\n- There is a 2 blocks gap between the 3x3 bedrock and the wall/fence.\n- The obsidian is to block the summon explosion from the wither, it will be destroyed after the wither is summoned.\n- Needs a layer of blocks around the wither's head to prevent wither targeting nearby mobs.",

#EDIT ME

By: <@869534786094518302>
Rates: 3.5k obsidian/hour
Consumes:
~6 flint and steels/hour
~6 stacks of junk items/hour (includes optional rail duper extension for junk item generation)

Credits:
Dark's scaffolding snow golem cage concept
cubicmetre's movable wither cage concept
Scorpio's idea using cod as a target for the wither

Build specs:
- requires only one player going through the portals
- fastest nether portal obsidian farm before the release of 1.21
- uses 1 wither in a movable wither cage, instead of two stationary cages
- relatively simple and cheap (uses half the wither skulls as other portal based designs)
- the portal is forced on the platform, so it's less coordinate sensitive
- requires less portal spawnproofing to run, than any other portal based obsidian farm
Downsides:
- obsolete due to changes in 1.21. isn't quite broken, but there are way better designs out there for newer versions
- requires the player to walk into the portal on their own (as F3+T mouse locking glitch resets upon reentry of a dimension)
- uses 6 stacks of junk items per hour to load chunks for the sake of simplicity
- nether side uses 1 slimeball (bad)
- directional due to how portals spawn (requires both sides to be facing the same direction)
- tricky wither summoning process

the cage has been tested with /tick warp and /carpet moreBlueSkulls for over 300 hours.

Note:
- from <@925291210325753907>'s observation, junk item dispenser is unnecessary, as the player loads the dimension upon reentry, but just to be sure i left it in. remove the item dispenser at your own risk 
- definitely works on SOME paper servers (tested on a few smp's) but it's not guaranteed to tolerate unloads and such
- might require less spawnproofing to run down in the caves, the higher you'll place the nether side portal.

Player-based portal generation obsidian farm
### Rates
- 3.5k/h
### Consumes
- Flint and steel: ~6/h
- Junk Item: ~6 stacks/h
### Credits
- Dark's scaffolding snow golem cage concept
cubicmetre's movable wither cage concept
Scorpio's idea using cod as a target for the wither
- The cage has been tested with /tick warp and /carpet moreBlueSkulls for over 300 hours.
 (includes optional rail duper extension for junk item generation)
## Features
- Requires only one player going through the portals
- Fastest nether portal obsidian farm before the release of 1.21
- Uses 1 wither in a movable wither cage, instead of two stationary cages
- Relatively simple and cheap (uses half the wither skulls as other portal based designs)
- The portal is forced on the platform, so it's less coordinate sensitive
- Requires less portal spawnproofing to run, than any other portal based obsidian farm
## Considerations
- Obsolete due to changes in 1.21. isn't quite broken, but there are way better designs out there for newer versions
- Requires the player to walk into the portal on their own (as F3+T mouse locking glitch resets upon reentry of a dimension)
- Uses 6 stacks of junk items per hour to load chunks for the sake of simplicity
- Nether side uses 1 slimeball (bad)
- Directional due to how portals spawn (requires both sides to be facing the same direction)
- Tricky wither summoning process
## Notes
- From Caribous's observation, junk item dispenser is unnecessary, as the player loads the dimension upon reentry, but just to be sure i left it in. remove the item dispenser at your own risk 
- Definitely works on SOME paper servers (tested on a few smp's) but it's not guaranteed to tolerate unloads and such
- Might require less spawnproofing to run down in the caves, the higher you'll place the nether side portal.

    "features": [
      "Requires only one player going through the portals",
      "Fastest nether portal obsidian farm before the release of 1.21",
      "Uses 1 wither in a movable wither cage, instead of two stationary cages",
      "Relatively simple and cheap (uses half the wither skulls as other portal based designs)",
      "The portal is forced on the platform, so it's less coordinate sensitive",
      "Requires less portal spawnproofing to run, than any other portal based obsidian farm"
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Obsolete due to changes in 1.21. isn't quite broken, but there are way better designs out there for newer versions",
      "Requires the player to walk into the portal on their own (as F3+T mouse locking glitch resets upon reentry of a dimension)",
      "Uses 6 stacks of junk items per hour to load chunks for the sake of simplicity",
      "Nether side uses 1 slimeball (bad)",
      "Directional due to how portals spawn (requires both sides to be facing the same direction)",
      "Tricky wither summoning process"
    ],
    "notes": "- From <@925291210325753907>'s observation, junk item dispenser is unnecessary, as the player loads the dimension upon reentry, but just to be sure i left it in. remove the item dispenser at your own risk \n- Definitely works on SOME paper servers (tested on a few smp's) but it's not guaranteed to tolerate unloads and such\n- Might require less spawnproofing to run down in the caves, the higher you'll place the nether side portal.\n- Original thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/913065809096638494/1182688931318345778"

  "description": "#EDIT ME\n\nBy: <@869534786094518302>\nRates: 3.5k obsidian/hour\nConsumes:\n~6 flint and steels/hour\n~6 stacks of junk items/hour (includes optional rail duper extension for junk item generation)\n\nCredits:\nDark's scaffolding snow golem cage concept\ncubicmetre's movable wither cage concept\nScorpio's idea using cod as a target for the wither\n\nBuild specs:\n- requires only one player going through the portals\n- fastest nether portal obsidian farm before the release of 1.21\n- uses 1 wither in a movable wither cage, instead of two stationary cages\n- relatively simple and cheap (uses half the wither skulls as other portal based designs)\n- the portal is forced on the platform, so it's less coordinate sensitive\n- requires less portal spawnproofing to run, than any other portal based obsidian farm\nDownsides:\n- obsolete due to changes in 1.21. isn't quite broken, but there are way better designs out there for newer versions\n- requires the player to walk into the portal on their own (as F3+T mouse locking glitch resets upon reentry of a dimension)\n- uses 6 stacks of junk items per hour to load chunks for the sake of simplicity\n- nether side uses 1 slimeball (bad)\n- directional due to how portals spawn (requires both sides to be facing the same direction)\n- tricky wither summoning process\n\nthe cage has been tested with /tick warp and /carpet moreBlueSkulls for over 300 hours.\n\nNote:\n- from <@925291210325753907>'s observation, junk item dispenser is unnecessary, as the player loads the dimension upon reentry, but just to be sure i left it in. remove the item dispenser at your own risk \n- definitely works on SOME paper servers (tested on a few smp's) but it's not guaranteed to tolerate unloads and such\n- might require less spawnproofing to run down in the caves, the higher you'll place the nether side portal.\noriginal thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/913065809096638494/1182688931318345778",

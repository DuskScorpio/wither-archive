The wither's main head targets one mob which then has the line of sight blocked. The side head targets another mob, with the line of sight remaining. This way the main head doesn't shoot. This is currently broken though, as the main head can gain line of sight to the hidden mob, thereby shooting sometimes. If this issue is fixed it should work.

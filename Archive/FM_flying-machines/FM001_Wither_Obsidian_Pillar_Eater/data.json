The snow golem at the top is targeted by the Wither's main head, and the iron golem behind the wall is targeted by the side heads.\n### Credits\n- DF_M: For making the prototype and helping me with debugging\n- Youmiel: For dragging me back to a bigger hell just when I thought I escaped (1.18 sucks, man)\nAnd for providing a 1.18 testing server and helping with pathfinding debugging. \n- <@513900971219353600> : For helping with withers and stuff\n- Menggui233: For directionality testing and robustness testing (mostly still done by myself)\n- FAS server: For 1.17 CMP\n- Wither Archive, Nub Tech and OSTC lab: For helping with lots of technical details\n### Video Links\n- [Showcase](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FL4y1u7dy/)\n- [User Guide](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FL4y1u7dy?p=2)\n### Files\n- [World Download and Schematics](https://wwd.lanzouf.com/b02ow52wd) (Password: 82j3)",

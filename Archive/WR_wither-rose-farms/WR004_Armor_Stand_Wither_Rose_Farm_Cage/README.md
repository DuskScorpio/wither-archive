A simple wither rose farm cage with armor stand to block the wither blue skulls
### Versions
- 1.16-1.20.1
## Features
- Works in all dimensions, no bedrock used.
- Rate depends on the mob farm used.
- Wither's main head skulls (blue and black) hits armor stand
- Side head skulls explode in solid block to damage mobs around.
## Notes
- The summoning method seems to only work in 1.18 and lower, you need to waterlog the slab and summon the wither directly under the slab instead.
- The design is not reload safe in 1.18+. The addition of a block under the feet and behind the head is suggested (as shown in the image attached)

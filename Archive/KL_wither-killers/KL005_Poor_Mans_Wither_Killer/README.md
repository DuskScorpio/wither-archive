"Poor" refers to the bedrock breaking area and item costs.
### Versions
- 1.14+
## Features
- Dispensers running out of wither skeleton skulls will cut off soul sand supply.
## Notes
- The bedrock needs two layers of 3x3, the main area that requires bedrock breaking is 5x4, and a few other locations depending on the situation.
- The green carpet is the safe area outside the wither blast range, and the red is the dangerous area.
- Some areas have not been spawn proofed, they should be below bedrock.
